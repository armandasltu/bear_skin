# CSS Structure

The css in Bear Skin is organized in an atomic structure. You will find most of the files within their component directory. ex: ```components/_patterns/02-molecules/messages/messages.css```

The ```00-utilities``` directories contains some "setup" css files where you can override BassCSS variables, add animations or additional reusable classes etc. You should get familiar with these prior to starting styling away.
